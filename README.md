# NDHU-CSIE-HW
1. This repository contains homework from Week 2 to now. (I forgot to save the files from Week 1)
2. The code will only be uploaded after it passed the online judge. Therefore, I may not be able to upload the code on the same day the problems release.
3. The file with .c extension is the original source code, while the other without an extension is the compiled file (should work on Ubuntu 22.04 x64 system).
4. Don't copy the code, but you can try to understand my algorithm and rewrite yourself. Remember that you have to demo it to the TA.
